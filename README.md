# BlackJack
This is a C++, text-based BlackJack card game played between a player and a computer dealer. The game is divided into 4 classes - a Card, Deck, Hand, and Chips class. There are also various functions to help run the loop of the game.

I started this project because I've always loved card games, especially BlackJack! While learning C++ for the first time, I wanted to create a game that would help me learn some of the language's most important concepts such as Object Oriented Programming. So, I decided to create this game.
